I am Lingchao Chen, from Chongqing, China, a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Texas at Dallas, mentored by Professor Lingming Zhang. I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests include regression testing, mutation testing, and machine-learning-oriented software engineering. I have plenty of experience working with large-scale data on various projects to reduce the cost of testing and speed up the testing process.
